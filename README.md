# Tea Framework
_Tea_ is a modding framework that functions as a mod, and is designed to
be used as a dependency by other mods for _tModLoader_.

It utilizes tModLoader's assembly/mod dependency functionality to provide
an additional layer of abstraction between numerous base tML calls as well
as providing numerous niche utilities.

_Tea_ is developed for the 1.4 _tModLoader_ alpha.

## What is Tea?
Stemming from a joke about the naming convention of Terraria-related
projects (see: **t**Shock, **t**ModLoader, **t**Config, **t**API), Tea
was originally envisioned as a sort of "competitor mod loader" (think
Forge vs Fabric (and I guess Quilt...) for Minecraft).

_Tea_ works off the base of an older library mod developed by
[myself](https://github.com/Steviegt6) called _TomatoLib_, recycling much
of the code originally used, thoughwith considerably better quality and
stripping away many redundancies.
