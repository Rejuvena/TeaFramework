# Introduction

**Tea Framework** is a progressive _modding framework_ and _library_ for [tModLoader](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Tea Framework is still a work-in-progress, expect the documentation to evolve over time.

Once a release comes out, no breaking changes will be made. If required, we will only mark members as obsolete.
{% endhint %}

### Installation

To learn how to install and use Tea Framework in your mod, see [here](installation/).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Tea Framework is a **commitment**. We not only expect you to have a solid grasp on C# and tModLoader, but also expect that you want to stay with Tea Framework. Tea Framework abstracts various components of tModLoader, so moving away from it may prove time-consuming.
{% endhint %}

### Understanding Service Providers and Singleton Lifetimes

Tea Framework's entire API is founded around the idea of a service provider that belongs to a `Terraria.ModLoader.Mod` instance. View the rundown [here](features/service-providers.md).

### Understanding the Reworked Load Cycle

Tea Framework overhauls how mod loading works for your mods, view the details [here](features/load-steps.md).
