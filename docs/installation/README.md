# Installation

Tea Framework and any secondary libraries that use it are all separate mods and assemblies, and you have to explicitly reference them in order to use them. There are multiple ways to achieve this.

### Mod Referencing

To learn how to reference Tea Framework in your project, see [here](referencing-tea-framework/).

### Library Loading

Tea Framework is _mostly_ pluggable, see how to utilize it here.
